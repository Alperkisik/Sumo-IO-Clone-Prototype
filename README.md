# Sumo-IO-Clone-Prototype
Basic prototype of Sumo IO game push mechanic
Very basic prototype which only has one gameplay mechanic which is the push mechanic.
The game is all about pushing players outside the arena.
When a player push other player, other player will get stunned for a small duration.
Stun means no movement.
- Character values can be changed at editor. Like movement speed, push force or stun duration etc.
